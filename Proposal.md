# Classification Model for Predicting Liver Patients

​	Scientists believe the liver is responsible for up to 500 separate vital functions in the human body, including fighting infections, dividing food into energy and helping the body dispose of waste. However, the liver is at risk from a range of factors, from poor diet and alcohol use to infections and other genetic factors, each of which can lead to liver disease, and if not detected early, severe damage can occur.

​	Patients with chronic viral hepatitis are at risk of cirrhosis, which can later develop into liver failure or cancer. When the patient reaches this stage, liver transplantation is the only option left to save his life. Therefore, early diagnosis of hepatitis offers wider treatment options and may eliminate the need of liver transplantation.

​	The goal of this project is predict the liver patient based on 10 features already available in the dataset. The model will help doctors to early diagnose the patient and propose a treatment. 

​	The data that going to be used is obtained from keggle community. There are 10 features that can be used that includes age, gender, Bilirubin, protein, albumin, alkphos and more. The goal is to create a model that can predicted the possible liver patient. To reach this conclusion, I will use classification and apply all the required procedures to reach my goal. 

​	For this project I will use KNN and logistic regression. Nonetheless, I might explore the data with other approaches as needed. The used tools will include but not limited to pandas, sql, matplotlib and python.   

​	I would like to get your approval on my project that focuses on analyzing data to come up with a plan for this scenario.
